# Voice-Based Patient Call System

## Overview
This project aims to develop a **voice-based patient call system** that allows patients to communicate their needs to nurses in a natural and convenient manner. The system leverages **Azure OpenAI** and **Autonomous AI Agents** to process, analyze, and prioritize patient requests.

### Key Features
- **Autonomous AI Agents**: AI-powered agents process and act upon patient requests based on predefined rules and priorities.
- **Speech Services Integration**: Converts speech to text and vice versa for seamless communication.
- **NLP-Powered Request Analysis**: Uses **Azure OpenAI** for analyzing and prioritizing patient requests.
- **Voice-Driven Communication System**: A user-friendly voice assistant for patients.
- **Nurse Mobile Application**: Displays real-time patient requests with room numbers and priority levels.
- **Improved Patient Care**: Ensures faster response times for critical requests.

## Installation & Setup

### 1. **Admin Frontend**
```sh
cd frontend_admin
npm install
npm start
```
Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### 2. **Admin Backend**
```sh
cd backend_admin
npm install
npm start
```
Runs the backend server.

### 3. **Voice Care Connect Backend**
```sh
cd voiceapp_backend
npm install
npm start
```

## Available Scripts

### **Frontend (React & React Native)**
- `npm start` - Starts the development server.
- `npm run build` - Builds the project for production.
- `npx expo start` - Runs the React Native app in Expo.

### **Backend (Node.js & Express)**
- `npm start` - Starts the backend server.
- `npm test` - Runs tests (if implemented).
- `npm run build` - Builds the backend for production.

## Deployment
- For **React Frontend**, build and deploy using:
  ```sh
  npm run build
  ```
- For **Backend**, deploy to **Heroku, AWS, or Azure** as needed.
- For **React Native Frontend**, use **Expo Publish**:
  ```sh
  expo publish
